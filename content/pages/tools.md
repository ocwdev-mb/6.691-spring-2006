The following MATLAB® scripts were provided to students in the course.

Sample Simulation Scripts
-------------------------

Simulation Subroutine ({{% resource_link e04cc2bb-3b05-e41e-cdbb-0d14833c7fb6 "M" %}})  
This is a function script that generates the derivatives of the state variables. It is called repeatedly by ode23 and so should be efficient.

Main Script ({{% resource_link 2eb269b5-af80-d5e1-f84b-8d343503a47c "M" %}})  
This is the MATLAB® program that runs the simulation.
